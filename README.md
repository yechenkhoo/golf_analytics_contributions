# Golf Swing Analytics System | Integrated Team Project
May 2025 - July 2025

## Brief Description
An AI-driven golf performance system that leverages Raspberry Pi (RPI), camera integration, and cloud-based machine learning to provide automated, real-time golf swing analysis.

## Contributions
Designed and deployed the Google Cloud Platform, utilising Cloud Functions for automated video processing, Cloud Run for ML model deployment, and Cloud Storage for scalable media handling. Helped with the implementation of RPI camera and live recording functions with MediaPipe-based pose detection, enabling automatic swing capture (P1â€“P10) without manual intervention. Integrated MongoDB with the cloud backend to manage user profiles, video metadata, and swing analysis results, ensuring smooth data flow between hardware, cloud services, and frontend

## Lessons Learnt
Gained hands-on experience with cloud-native deployment (serverless functions, containerised ML models, and scalable storage). Learned how to integrate IoT hardware with cloud services, including real-time video streaming, AI inference, and data persistence.
